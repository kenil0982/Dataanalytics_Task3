Sales and Products Analytics
This project provides an SQL-based analysis of sales data, including product details, sales trends, revenue calculations, and product category performance. The database consists of two key tables: sales and products. This project uses SQL queries for data analysis and insights.

üìä Project Overview
This repository contains SQL scripts that demonstrate various analytics operations such as:

Querying product sales summary

Aggregating revenue and quantities sold

Creating views for easy access to analytics

Optimizing queries with indexes for better performance

üîç Key Queries and Views
Product Sales Summary View
This view aggregates the total quantity sold and total revenue per product.

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE VIEW product_sales_summary AS
SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    p.product_category,
    COUNT(s.sale_id) AS total_sales,
    SUM(s.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold,
    SUM(s.quantity * s.price) AS total_revenue
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN sales s ON p.product_name = s.product_name
GROUP BY p.product_name, p.product_category;
Total Revenue by Product Category
Summarizes the revenue by each product category.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    p.product_category,
    SUM(s.quantity * s.price) AS category_revenue
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN products p ON s.product_name = p.product_name
GROUP BY p.product_category
ORDER BY category_revenue DESC;
Top-Selling Products by Quantity
Displays the top-selling products based on the quantity sold.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    SUM(s.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN products p ON s.product_name = p.product_name
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC
LIMIT 10;
Sales Trend Over Time (By Date)
Tracks sales performance by date.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    DATE(s.sale_date) AS sale_date,
    SUM(s.quantity * s.price) AS total_revenue
FROM sales s
GROUP BY sale_date
ORDER BY sale_date;
Products with No Sales
Identifies products that have not been sold.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT 
    p.product_name
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN sales s ON p.product_name = s.product_name
WHERE s.sale_id IS NULL;
‚ö° Optimization
Indexes
To improve the performance of queries, especially those with joins, the following indexes can be created:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE INDEX idx_product_name ON sales (product_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_sale_date ON sales (sale_date);
